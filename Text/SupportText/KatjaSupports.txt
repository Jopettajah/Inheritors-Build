"Cerulean Croissant"[Beat][N]
"Vision Quiche"[ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
Are these[Beat] recipes?[N]
What weird names[Beat][A]
[MidRight][LoadAnis]
Ah![.4] You found it![N]
"The Yeast Promise"![AN]
I knew I dropped it somewhere![A]
[MidLeft]
The yeast what now?[A]
[MidRight]
"The Yeast Promise"![N]
Thats what I call my recipe book![AN]
Well,[n] right now it's just[N]
a notebook and a working title[Beat][A]
[MidLeft]
Uh-huh.[.4] Here,[.] have it back.[N]
Hm?[.4] Whats this?[AN]
"The Morrow's Golden Cobbler"?[N]
That looks mighty delish![A]
[MidRight]
I think we should have all the[N]
necessary ingredients for it.[AN]
Want to try making it later?[A]

[MidRight][LoadAnis]
What if I reduced[n]
the flour to[Beat][AN]
Or perhaps[ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[MidLeft][LoadKatja]
Brainstorming new stuff for[N]
your book again?[A]
[MidRight]

[MidLeft]
Why did you start working[n]
on that thing anyway?[A]
[MidRight]
It's just[Beat] my greatest[N]
dream, I suppose.[AN]
I've always wanted to publish[n]
my recipes in a cookbook.[AN]
To share the joy of baking[n]
with as many people as possible.[A]
[MidLeft]
Quite a lofty goal,[.] huh.[A}
[MidRight]
Do you have any dreams[N]
yourself,[.] Katja?[A]
[MidLeft]
Hmm[Beat][.4] I can't say I've[n]
given it much thought.[AN]
//[MidRight]
//No grand ideals for leaving
//your mark on the world?
//[MidLeft]
Most of my time was spent serving ale and[n]
getting into brawls witn rowdy customers.[AN]
It's a simple living,[.4] but I've[n]
been content with it so far.[A]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Especially with the parts[n]
related to brawling?[A]
[MidLeft]
Heh,[.] you know me![N]
Can't say no to a good tussle.[A]
[MidRight]
Well[Beat] Maybe your calling is to[n]
be the best barmaid on the continent?[AN]
Or at the very least the one who can[N]
throw a drunken fool the furthest![A]
[MidLeft]
Now that's a goal I can get behind![A]

[MidRight][LoadAnis]
Are you alright,[.] Katja?[N]
You've been deep in thought lately.[A]
[MidLeft]
Oh,[.] it's nothing.[AN]
I've just been thinking some stuff[n]
over after our last conversation.[A]
[MidRight]
The one about our grand dreams?[A]
[MidLeft]//[ThreeLineBox]
Yeah,[.] that one.[.4][N]
After all this fighting is done,[AN]
I'll probably have had my fill of[N]
skullcracking for while.[AN]
I'll most likely return[N]
to my life as simple barmaid.[A]
[MidRight]
So still no grand ideals for[N]
leaving your mark on the world?[AN]
I suppose there is nothing wrong[N]
in wanting a simple and stable life.[A]
[MidLeft]
Well[Beat][.7][N]
There's more to it now,[.] actually.[A]
[MidRight]
More?[.4] What do you mean?[A]
[MidLeft]
I was thinking[Beat][.4] If your cookbook[N]
doesn't pan out as expected[Beat][AN]
I was wondering if you'd like[N]
to would come along with me?[A]
[MidRight]
Wait,[.] me?[A]
[MidLeft]
If your recipes can't end up as a book,[N]
they should at least be in a menu.[AN]
The boss is a good man,[.][N]
I can convince him to hire you.[A]
[MidRight]
You'd do that,[.4] all for me?[A]
[MidLeft]
Of course.[.4] You're a good friend, Anis.[AN]
Both your kindness and baking[N]
skills are execptional.[AN]
It would be a shame to waste them.[A]
[MidRight]
I'll have take you up on your offer then.[.4][N][ToggleSmile]
Toghether we'll put the inn on a culinary map![A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Let's hope you don't scare[N]
any customers off with your[N]
with your weird names![A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Hey![.4] "Scone of Jaskr" or[N]
"Faces of a Strudel" aren't that weird![A]
